# mysql-hibernate-jpa-application
I have developed this application to give a deep understanding on how to work with hibernate in spring boot. I have used Jpa repository here you can also use crud repository.  Refer to application.properties file to configure your database details. Make sure to create testdb and have tutorials table inside it. You can clone the repo and run it.
